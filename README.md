# Mentor-Allocation-System

<p align="justify">
The Mentor Allocation System is a simple platform that allows mentees to choose and manage their mentors. Mentees can log in, select a mentor, change their selection if needed, and save their choice if the mentor is still available. Mentors can log in to view and organize mentees by course, branch, and specialization, and they also have the option to remove a mentee if necessary. One Mentor can have a maximum of 20 mentees under him/her. When a mentor exceeds his/her limit, their name will not be shown in the available mentors list. This system simplifies mentor selection, communication, and management.
